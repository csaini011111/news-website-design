## 1. Introduction

CZUNews is an innovative news platform that presents news from the year 2070, created as a student project for the Web Design course at Czech University of Life Sciences Prague. The website combines futuristic content with modern web design principles to deliver an engaging user experience.

Our platform features a comprehensive news ecosystem with categories including Technology, Science, and Business, each presenting forward-looking articles that imagine the world of 2070. The website includes features such as article recommendations, user comments, social sharing, and a premium subscription model.

The design emphasizes usability and accessibility, with a responsive layout that works seamlessly across all devices. We've implemented modern UI elements like glass-morphism and gradient effects while maintaining readability and navigation clarity. The project demonstrates our understanding of contemporary web development practices while showcasing creative storytelling through a futuristic lens.
